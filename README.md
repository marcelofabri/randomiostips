=============

Random iOS Tips (www.randomiostips.com) is a site with some handy (and random!) tips about iOS development.

The website is made with Python on Google App Engine (GAE). The web stuff was made using Twitter's Bootstrap.

Besides the main feature, there's also a cron schedule to run daily, to tweet a tip that hasn't been tweeted yet (using tweepy). 


PS: I know the way I choose one random tip is not the best one, but it's enough by now.
