=============

Random iOS Tips (www.randomiostips.com) is a site with some handy (and random!) tips about iOS development.

The website is made with Python on Google App Engine (GAE).

Besides the main feature, there's also a cron schedule to run daily, to tweet a tip that hasn't been tweeted yet. 


PS: I know the way I choose one random tip is not the best one, but it's enough by now.
